Megaface
========

### A Pebble Time watchface that I like.

Creatively reworked version of https://github.com/Marckus/Words_Date_Day2

Differences:
 - Pebble Time (color screen) support
 - Battery level display
 - Internals mostly rewritten
 - (TODO) Notification on bluetooth disconnect
 - (TODO) Seconds display

Known bugs:
 - Displays "noon oh one" and so on.
